# hello-topcoat

A [Topcoat](https://github.com/tokio-rs/topcoat) application.

## Development

Install the Topcoat CLI:

```sh
cargo install topcoat-cli
```

Start the development server, which rebuilds the application when you edit its source:

```sh
topcoat dev
```

Then open <http://127.0.0.1:3000>.

## Project structure

| Path | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `src/app.rs`, `src/app/` | The route tree: the router, layouts, pages, and routes. |
| `src/features.rs`, `src/features/` | Everything one feature owns, such as its data and business rules. |

Pages in `app` use features and components. A feature can use shared components but never imports from `app`, and shared components never import from a feature.
